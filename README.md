# BeamMP-HeadlessClient
Headless Client for BeamMP

This repo is not maintained. The list that was shown here before is outdated, i find it hard to tell how much a feature is completed. I am doing alot of internal work of the HC at the moment to make the integration of features and gamemodes easier. The project has 26 thousand lines of code already and contains code of 5 programming languages. If you want to receive updates of the Development of this tool and maybe get a chance to become a closed alpha tester in the future then hop onto our beam\\\\cruise discord, as i share updates there: http://discord.gg/EQMzWP6rDc
